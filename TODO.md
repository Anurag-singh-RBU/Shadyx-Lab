# TODO: Fix User Creation in Convex from Clerk Webhook

- [x] Verify CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable is set correctly in .env (Skipped: Cannot read .env file)
- [x] Add logging in webhook handler (convex/http.ts) for webhook receipt and errors
- [x] Add logging in syncUser mutation (convex/users.ts) for user insertion confirmation
- [ ] Test webhook by creating a user in Clerk and check logs for errors or success (User action required)
